### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Mandela Houngnibo**, an agro-hydro-meteorologist serving as a junior expert at AGRHYMET RCC-WAS. You might know me from such hits as the world's largest collection of Covid-19 data, the public data set on the 2019 Samoan measles outbreak, the public data set on the 2018 West African EBOV outbreak and the first community-driven book on Julia. My book, The Computational Modeling of Infectious Disease, is now available at all good booksellers and of course Amazon. I rant about things here â€“ recently, mostly about LLMs.
